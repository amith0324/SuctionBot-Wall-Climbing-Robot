# SuctionBot – Wall Climbing Robot

## Project Overview
SuctionBot is an ESP32-based wall-climbing cleaning robot.
It uses suction and rotating brushes to clean vertical surfaces
like walls and glass panels.

The robot is controlled wirelessly using a web-based interface.

## Web Interface
The ESP32 hosts a local website.
When connected to ESP32 Wi-Fi, open:

http://192.168.4.1

Hardware is required to access this page.

## Features
- ESP32 Wi-Fi control
- Web-based dashboard
- Brushless motor with ESC for suction
- TB6612FNG motor driver
- DC motors for movement
- Servo motors for cleaning brushes

## Technologies Used
